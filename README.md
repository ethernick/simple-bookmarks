# Simple Bookmark

A simple little plugin to run my bookmarks out of WordPress. Postmarks was... ok. 
But after using the ActivityPub plugin, I thought, why shouldn't I run this from WordPress?

The first link of the post, is the bookmark; the rest is the federated post. 

THe plugin Settings, allows you to specific the Category IDs you wnt to run the bookmarks, otherwise 
all posts with a link will be a bookmark. And maybe that's ok.

I'm also planning on using this a "bookmarks" user so that I can federated content shows up like 
Postmark.
